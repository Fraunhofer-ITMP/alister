<h2>
 Introduction
</h2>

ALISTER is a web-app containing scientific information on pre-analytical blood sample stability in metabolomics and lipidomics. With a user-friendly interface and easy navigation, the app provides you with accurate and current information, essential for any researcher or scientist working in these fields. Current app contents are limited to the influences of time delay and temperature during processing of (EDTA) plasma and serum samples, which have been identified to be among the major pre-analytical pitfalls. Within four different menus, the app aims to answer pre-analytical questions regarding two general scenarios. In prospective scnarios the app aims to advice on sampling protocols, that ensure stability of analytes of interest. In retrospective assessment of samples, that ALISTER assesses analytes stability based on pre-analytical sample information provided by the use.
The following document gives an overview over the app functionalities.
